# WhatARide 🚴‍♂️🎮

**WhatARide** is a quirky and challenging 3D game developed in just 3 days during the GameJam competition in Tunisia. The theme was **"Make Me Laugh,"** and the game lives up to its promise with hilarious silly deaths and entertaining mechanics. Drawing inspiration from the chaotic fun of **Happy Wheels** and the intense challenge of **Only Up** and **Jump King**, WhatARide is a test of both your humor and perseverance.
